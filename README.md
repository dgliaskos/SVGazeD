# SVGazeD is a statistical index suitable for modeling aggregated visual perception differences during the observation of different cartographic backgrounds.
The calculation of SVGazeD is based on the computation of the GraphGazeD metric and on the utilization of raw experimental eye tracking data.

This metric considers the area under the curve (AUC) of the mathematical models (6th degree polynomial function, rectangular hyperbola function, logistic function) that could be used in order to produce the GraphGazeD metric.
SVGazeD simplifies the GraphGazeD by providing a single-value metric that compares aggregated observation patterns among alternative cartographic backgrounds.
